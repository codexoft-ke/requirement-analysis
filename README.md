# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository contains a comprehensive requirement analysis for a booking management system. It simulates a real-world software development scenario, focusing on accurately capturing, documenting, and structuring requirements to form a strong foundation for successful project delivery.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of understanding, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It ensures that developers and clients have a shared understanding of what the system should do, forming a blueprint for development.

It is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves activities such as gathering requirements, analyzing them, validating, and modeling them to guide the development process.
