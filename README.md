# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository contains a comprehensive requirement analysis for a booking management system. It simulates a real-world software development scenario, focusing on accurately capturing, documenting, and structuring requirements to form a strong foundation for successful project delivery.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of understanding, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It ensures that developers and clients have a shared understanding of what the system should do, forming a blueprint for development.

It is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves activities such as gathering requirements, analyzing them, validating, and modeling them to guide the development process.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. **Clear Understanding:** It ensures stakeholders and developers have a common understanding of the system goals.
2. **Prevents Scope Creep:** Proper analysis minimizes unexpected changes and uncontrolled growth in project scope.
3. **Improves Quality:** Clearly defined requirements lead to well-structured design and robust systems.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering:** Collecting input from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, etc.
- **Requirement Elicitation:** Drawing out and refining requirements by understanding user needs.
- **Requirement Documentation:** Recording requirements in a structured, readable format.
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:** Organizing, prioritizing, and modeling requirements for clarity.
- **Requirement Validation:** Ensuring requirements align with business goals and are feasible.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
These define what the system should do.
**Examples:**
- Users can create bookings for rooms.
- Admins can cancel or update bookings.
- System sends email confirmation upon successful booking.

### Non-functional Requirements
These define how the system should perform.
**Examples:**
- The system should respond to user requests within 2 seconds.
- The booking system must be available 24/7.
- Data must be encrypted during transmission.
